### Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

HTML, CSS and JavaScript all do different things on a website. HTML is the structure and tells the browser what to show. CSS makes it look good with colors, fonts and layout. JavaScript makes the page interactive, like buttons you can click or content that changes. HTML builds the page, CSS styles it and JavaScript makes it work.
