### What is the difference between Git and Github?

Git is a free tool that keeps track of changes in your files and lets you go back to earlier versions, work on separate branches, and collaborate without losing work. You can use it on your computer even without the internet. GitHub is an online platform that works with Git and lets you save your projects, share them with others, and work together on the same project. So basically, Git tracks your work, and GitHub stores it and helps you collaborate.
