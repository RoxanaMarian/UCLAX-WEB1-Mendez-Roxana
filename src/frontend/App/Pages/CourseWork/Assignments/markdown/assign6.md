### What is the difference between jpg, gif, png and svg images?

JPG makes files smaller by losing some detail, so it’s good for photos but not for text or logos, and it doesn’t support transparency. GIF can do simple animations and supports basic transparency but only uses 256 colors, so it’s not great for detailed images. PNG keeps full quality, handles sharp lines and text well, and supports transparency, but the files are bigger. SVG is a vector format made from shapes and lines, so it can be resized without losing quality and is great for logos, icons, and illustrations.
