### Define the following Agile roles

Agile is a way of building software in small steps, checking progress often, and adjusting as needed. Different roles make the team work smoothly:

-   Product Manager (PM): Decides what the software should do and what features are most important. They focus on what the product is.
-   Scrum Master: Makes sure the team follows Agile processes, organizes meetings, and removes obstacles. They focus on how the team works.
-   UX Designer: Designs how the product looks and feels, making it easy and enjoyable to use.
-   Developer/Engineer: Writes the code to make the product work, implements features, and fixes bugs.
-   QA / SDET: Tests the product to catch bugs and make sure everything works correctly.
-   DevOps: Ensures the software runs smoothly for everyone, handles updates, servers, and deployment.
